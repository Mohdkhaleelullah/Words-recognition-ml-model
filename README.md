# Utilizing Custom Google Media Pipe Hand Gesture Recognizer Model for Home Automation using Low-cost ESP32
This project proposes a system that utilizes real-
time hand gesture recognition to control electronic devices for
home automation using a low-cost ESP32 micro controller. The
system leverages the custom-made Model ”HandFlow” made by
up-scaling retrained Media Pipe Model Maker, a framework from
Google, for real-time hand gesture detection. Users interact with
a web interface to control devices through hand gestures.
